            Do not imagine that mathematics is hard and crabbed, and repulsive to common sense. It is merely the etherealization of common sense.

            There is no thing as a man who does not create mathematics and yet is a fine mathematics teacher. 
            Textbooks, course material-these do not approach in importance the communication of what mathematics is really about, of where it is going, and of where it currently stands with respect to the specific branch of it being taught.
             What really matters is the communication of the spirit of mathematics. 
            It is a spirit that is active rather than contemplative-a spirit of disciplined search for adventures of the intellect. 
            Only as adventurer can really tell of adventures.
